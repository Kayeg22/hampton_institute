# States as Settler Creations

## Algonquian-speakers and the Cherokee Nation

Before the arrival of the colonists in 1607, what is now known as the United States did not look anything like what we see on a map today. Indigenous nations and their people did not draw boundary lines like what the Federal Government did to divide Indigenous land into states.

Jessica Taylor, in *Plain Paths and Dividing Lines: Navigating Native Land and Water in the Seventeenth-Century Chesapeake*, states that Algonquian-speaking groups on the Virginia coast "transformed Chesapeake waterways into lines of connection between families and towns."^\[1\]^ Instead of marking lines of ownership, the natural world offered a sense of kinship and community.

Theda Perdue noted similar patterns among the early eighteenth century Cherokee. Part of the Iroquoian language family, the Cherokee people "spoke several dialects of a common language...but no clear boundaries demarcated their territory and no political authority delineated citizenship."^\[2\]^ Though no Native American culture is the same, the similarities between the Cherokee in present-day Oklahoma and Algonquian-speakers like as the Appamattucks are important to recognize.

## Boundaries and Settler Encroachment

Boundaries can be described as "the imaginary, geographical places where assertions of property or sovereignty begin and end, made by practices of marking them on trees or measuring them with survey instruments or reminding one another that the line marks a division between at least two different places." ^\[\\3\]^

Since the seventeenth century, acts of violence against the Indigenous people of this land have been waged. The forced removal and relegation of Indigenous people to reservations in the nineteenth century were acts of organized violence by settler-colonial institutions. The actions taken by the Federal Government are indicative of an attempt to assert its' sovereignty and deny the same ability to the thousands of Indigenous people that were forced to leave their ancestral lands.
